# AMD Adrenalin VGM configuration (manual)

**Complete this before installing Lemonade. Requires a reboot.**

GPU memory on Windows is set through AMD's Adrenalin driver UI — there is no command-line
equivalent on Windows. By default the GPU memory allocation is very conservative (4–8 GB),
which causes llama.cpp (the engine Lemonade uses on the iGPU) to route 30B models to the CPU.

## Steps

1. Download AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 25.8.1 WHQL or later
   - URL: https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/drivers.html
   - Category: Graphics → Integrated Graphics → Radeon 8060S

2. Run the installer. Reboot if prompted.

3. Open **AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition**

4. Go to: **Performance** → **Tuning** → **System** → **Variable Graphics Memory**

5. Change the dropdown to **Custom**

6. Enter **96** (GB)
   - Rationale: 96 GB GPU + 32 GB system RAM is the recommended split for LLM use.
   - 32 GB is sufficient for Windows 11, Chrome, VS Code, and the full Python agent stack.
   - Do not set to 128 GB — Windows needs at least 16–32 GB system RAM to operate.

7. Click **Apply**, then **Restart Now**

8. After reboot, re-run `infra\00_check_hardware.ps1` and confirm GPU VRAM ~96 GB

## Verification in Lemonade after model load

```powershell
# Load the coder model on the iGPU (ROCm), then check it is resident:
lemonade-server load Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF --llamacpp rocm
lemonade-server ps
# The 30B coder should show ~18 GB on the GPU (not CPU, not 0).
# Then benchmark: .\infra\04_benchmark.ps1  (single-digit tok/s means it fell back to CPU)
```
