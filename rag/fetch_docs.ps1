# fetch_docs.ps1 — one-shot bootstrap of the full RAG corpus for all three
# platforms, then build the ChromaDB collections.
#
# This is a thin front-end over rag/refresher.py, which is the single source of
# truth for which docs we track and is ALSO what runs automatically on every
# `python cli.py` launch to keep the corpus current (SHA-tracked, incremental).
# Running this script does a full forced fetch + re-ingest — use it for first-
# time setup or to rebuild everything from scratch.
#
#   Databricks : official platform docs from docs.databricks.com (~4,360 pages,
#                enumerated from sitemap.xml) + delta-io/delta OSS docs
#   Snowflake  : connector/snowpark READMEs + sfquickstarts guides
#   AWS        : botocore service definitions,
#                PLUS boto3 SDK client references (generated below)
#
# NOTE: the Databricks platform scrape fetches thousands of pages and takes
# ~10 minutes on a first run. Tune with RAG_WEB_WORKERS / RAG_WEB_DELAY_S.
